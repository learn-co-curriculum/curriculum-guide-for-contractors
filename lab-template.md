# Lab Outline:

Labs are the category of repositories that include some form of coding practice. This could be:

* a **spec lab** that involves writing code to pass tests

* a **Code-Along** that does not involve independent problem solving to pass tests, but rather gives heavy-handed direction to write specific lines of code. Code-Alongs, however, should also include tests and students are still expected to pass them even if you're telling them exactly how to do so. In many cases, a Code-Along can take the place of a Readme that would cover the same topic. 

## Examples

Spec Lab:

  * [Objc — WWDC Badges With Methods](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/wwdc-badges-methods)

Code-Along:

  * [Objc — Speaking Grandma](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/objc-speaking-grandma)

## Format of a Lab Readme
### `#` Title
The title comes first. It should be the name of the repository.

### `##` Objectives
Objectives should immediately follow the title of the lab. Students should be able to readily find and define the skills they should be expected to practice or learn by completing the lab.

### `##` Introduction
The introduction should discuss the premise, or scenario of the lab. It should set the stage for the work the students will be doing.

### `##` Instructions
Instructions should be a numbered list of steps to take when solving the lab. This section can include a leading paragraph if its content does not fit into the numerical order (i.e., "After forking and cloning this lab, open the `*.xcworkspace` file.").

Instructions should be be specific. Students shouldn't have to make assumptions about what to do based on the instructions, they should immediately know. 

Instructions should be written in order of how to approach the lab. If you need to build a class before you can define any methods, the instructions should lead the student to build the class first.


## Lab Templates

### Templates

* fundamental-ruby
* command-line
* SQL
* activerecord
* rake
* erb-static-site
* rack
* sinatra-classic
* sinatra-mvc
* js
* front-end

Note for rails labs moving forward we should be using [flatiron-rails](https://github.com/flatiron-school/flatiron-rails) to generate new Rails labs.
