# Creating A Lab

You've written a phenomenal lesson, and now it's time to test your students to see how much they learned. A lab is a time for students to put the skills they've learned to the test.

## Purpose of A Lab

The purpose of a lab is for students to practice what is taught in a lecture or through a reading. Students become developers when they are working on labs.

Because of this, we want our labs to be challenging but applicable. Students should feel pushed intellectually with each lab, but not overwhelmed.

For this reason, our overall curriculum should include labs of varying degrees of difficulty. For important Units or Lessons, we should make sure that there are Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced labs. This also creates flexibility on a semester-by-semester, or even student-by-student basis: we can deploy lab(s) applicable for individual learning paces.


## Naming Convention

Naming convention is helpful for instructors to at a glance know what a lab is covering and if it should be assigned. MLabs should be named to correspond with the Topics defined on Learn. It should at the very least begin with the name of the Topic. The last word should be `lab` (to distinguish it from a Readme). For example:

* "Rails-Blog-Nested-Resources-lab"
* "SQL-Library-lab"
* "Sinatra-Nested-Forms-lab"
* "js-oo-task-list-lab"

Again, notice that all the examples above end with `lab`. This is important because it helps us distinguish a lab from a lesson just by the repository name.

## Content

Ideally, a lab should focus on one Learn Lesson. Of course, many of our labs require students to practice more than one skill, especially in more complex full application labs. But most effective labs are granular, because they allow a student to hone in and focus on one skill. 

Try to keep your labs focused to one lesson. For Rails and more complex topics, our labs should be granular, with each iteration building off the preceding one. An example of this is the Rails Blog Domain, which is comprised of the following labs, all of which are iterations on top of the preceding lab:

1. Rails Blog Scaffold
2. Rails Blog Associations Validations
3. Rails Blog Nested Forms
4. Rails Blog Nested Resources
5. Rails Blog Sessions
6. Rails Blog Omniauth
7. Rails Blog Asset Pipeline

## Readme

Your lab's Readme is the first point of reference about your lab to a student. And, if you're making a tutorial or resource that isn't a full lab, your Readme is everything.

Your Readme sets the student up for what scanario or context in which they're building. It's important to connect the lab with real world context or actual situations. Context provides a reason for a student to struggle. Once they know the purpose of the skill they're learning, they can become motivated by the things they can build with that skill.

If you're teaching methods, talk about a situation in which you'd want the same action to take place over and over again - like Facebook sending happy birthday emails to every user on their birthday.

If you're teaching arrays, an example where you'd want to store a group of objects and do the same action to each item in that group.


## Instructions

Lab instructions should err on the side of overly-specific. The worst thing in the world is to have a student confused and struggling with material because the instructions are unclear. We would rather give the student more instructions and risk annoyance over too much reading, than too little. If you need a student to create a database table, tell them exactly what columns the table should have. They shouldn't have to guess. It's not giving it away to tell them what to build; they still have to figure out **how** to build it.

Instructions should be written in order of how to solve the problem. Really big labs or labs that cover complex topics can feel really overwhelming. Students learn the patterns of how to approach larger projects by reading instructions in the order in which they should tackle the problem.


## Solution Branch

Every lab should have a solution branch. Your solution branch should have a clean, understandable solution that other instructors can refer to for lab reviews and helping students. Sometimes, students might want the solution pushed up to them after they've completed the lab, so it's important that the solution is straightforward.

## Regular Lab vs. Stretch Lab

A normal lab should test the student on exactly what they just learned in the lesson or code along. Every piece to the solution should be able to be referenced in the previous lesson. They only lines of code they should have to write are the skills they should be practicing.

A stretch lab is a lab that requires students to put some of the pieces together themselves. The point is that a student should be far removed from their comfort zone during a stretch lab. We should be stretching the boundaries of their learning. Several components of a stretch lab:

+ Provide less instructions
+ Tests only cover the big picture and not each individual line of code they have to write
+ Provide less starter code.
+ Require a student to Google some information to complete the lab
+ Incorporate passed a student has learned to pass all the tests


## How to Approach Building A Lab

Sometimes it can feel daunting to approach building a lab. There are many ways to do it, none more correct that the other.

If you need a little help getting started, we recommend you start at the end and work your way forward. Start by build the solution you want your students to create in the lab, then build the tests that test the skills you want the lab to practice.From there, write your Readme with clearly stated objectives and instructions.

All work should be done on a `work-in-progress` branch and a `solution` branch.

## Extras

We always want to make sure our students are having fun, and a lot of that can be achieved through the tone of the lab. Here are some ways to achieve that:

+ The lab topic or intro can be humorous
+ A good gif
