# Your Course Outline 

You’re an expert in your topic. You’ve worked professionally in it and might even have published books or articles about it as well. And that’s why we’re working with you to develop curriculum!

But creating a course, writing an outline, and developing your syllabus for students on the topic that you know so well requires you to think differently and from the perspective of a learner. 

## Start with the End in Mind
When designing your course, think of what you want your student to accomplish. 

What is the final project that they will be working on at the very end of your course? This final project should be comprehensive and challenging enough for a student to be able to get a job as a junior developer in that particular topic. It should take between 10-20 hours for a student to complete, and we can adjust that length by simply adjusting the starter code that we’re giving students. As an example, when students complete our Sinatra course, they should be able to build a Twitter clone. 

Map out your final project. List the requirements and what students should be expected to do to build it. 

In this final projects, students will be able to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
etc.

Now that you have your final project, let’s think about your course as a map that guides your students to this project. 

## Creating Your Units
What are the main milestones (both skills and knowledge areas) that students need to pass to be able to complete this project? You don’t need to get too specific and there is no set number of milestones. You know your topic better than anyone else, so if you feel that that’s 20 separate milestones, that’s totally fine. If you think it might be closer to 10, not a problem either. 

Oftentimes when you’re figuring out the milestones, you’ll find yourself working backwards from the end. That’s fine, but once you’re done, list the milestones in the sequential order in which you think they should be covered. 

Now change milestones to units. Congratulations! You’ve just broken your large topic into much more manageable units.

Here are the sample Milestones/Units in our Ruby on Rails Curriculum:

Section    | Topic
-----------|-------------------------------------------
1          | Intro to Rails and What it Is
2          | Rails Models Basics
3          | REST
4          | ActionView
5          | CRUD with Rails
6          | Validations and Forms
7          | Associations and Rails
8          | Refactoring with Partials
9          | Refactoring with Helpers and Private Methods
10         | Routes and Resources
11         | Authentication
12         | Asset Pipeline
13         | Popular Gems
14         | Consuming APIs
15         | Building APIs





## Breaking Your Unit Down into Lessons
Let’s take a closer look at the unit. What are the specific things  students need to be able to do at the end of a unit? And what’s your plan for how they should get there? In other words, what are the actions, skills, and knowledge that they need? Wherever possible, focus on the actions that students are taking and not the knowledge itself. Always remember that learning is about doing, and not about content.

For each of your units, list these down in the sequential order in which they should be covered. 

Congratulations again! You now have a rough outline of the lessons that your unit will include. Sometimes, one action or skill can be its own lesson. Other times, it might need to be several lessons. Or in other cases, you can combine multiple actions and skills into a single lesson. Again, you know your topic better than anyone else so use your judgement and shape those expected student actions, skills, and knowledge into lessons.  

Units can also vary in length. We don’t have a standard for how many lessons belong in a unit since we understand that some units take less time to cover while others might be more difficult and need more lessons devoted to them. 

Also remember that when we talk about lessons, we mean both Readmes and Labs. Our typical flow is that every Readme should immediately be followed by a Coding Lab so that a student can immediately apply the skills they’ve just learned. Towards the end of each unit, we also also want to have more difficult labs that encompass multiple concepts (some of which can come from previous units) and require more of students.

Rework your list of lessons from above to include the breakdown of Readmes and Labs in your unit.

Sample Rails Unit Breakdown for Association in Rails:


Content    | Topic
-----------|-------------------------------------------
Readme     | Association Recap
Lab        | Rails Join the Fun
Lab        | Flatiron BNB Associations
Lab        | Flatiron BNB Methods
Readme     | Displaying Association Data
Lab        | Displaying Association Data Lab
Readme     | Forms and Basic Associations
Lab        | Forms and Basic Associations Lab
Readme     | Basic Nested Forms
Lab        | Basic Nested Forms Lab
Readme     | Displaying Has Many Through
Lab        | Displaying Has Many Through Lab
Readme     | Has Many Through in Forms
Lab        | Has Many Through in Forms Lab
Lab        | Rails Blog Complex Nested Forms
Lab        | Rails Blog Assications and Validations Lab
Lab        | Rails Pollywog Ranch Lab



And there you go! Now you have a solid high level outline of your course. This will go through several iterations. You might in your process, learn that a unit needs to be broken down even further or that there were missing units and lessons you hadn’t considered. That’s totally fine and expected!

## And Just a Little Bit More on Lessons
When we think about the learning journey students take, we want to be very thoughtful about the material they encounter and how to maintain both consistency but also present new scenarios and situations that’ll challenge and test them. 

As you work through the lessons and labs in your units, think of a couple of narrative domains that you can across your labs. For example, when we cover Rails, a lot of our labs cover the domain of creating a blog and creating an Airbnb clone.  When we cover Ruby, a lot of our labs will cover a music playlist app domain or more simply, a lot of labs will deal with the domain topic of students and classes.  These  labs will build cumulatively across  various units and give a sense of consistency that’s important for online learners.

At the same time, we also include other, usually more difficult labs that cover domains students haven’t encountered before since we want them to be able to practice their coding skills across a variety of scenarios and situations. 

## Questions to Keep Asking Yourself
As you’re reviewing your outline, think about the following questions:


Does the course have a logical, smooth progression for students?

Do your units and lessons give a complete sense of the skills that a student will need to actually work as a developer in the topic?

How can you ensure that the flow of your Readmes and Labs keep students engaged and challenged? For example, with more difficult concepts or units, how can you keep a student’s momentum going without making the labs and information presented too easy?
