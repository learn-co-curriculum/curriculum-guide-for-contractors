# Workflow for Curriculum Creation and Review

We use Google Sheets to keep track of all work that's being done in a specific unit, topic, or course. Use this [sample spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DxZ_Iwnk9X6cMNrQBtVVgJnhsOezJ4ez2WTq7MX2ges/edit#gid=0&vpid=A2) as an example of how we manage curriculum. 

If you notice in the spreadsheet there are some Data Validations in the Stage and Difficulty columns. You don't need to worry about the Difficulty column as these will be filled out. But for the different options in the Stage column, let's take a closer look.

**Define Objectives**: In this stage, either you or someone from the Flatiron team will be defining the learning objectives/outline for the content. 

If you're defining the learning objectives, then in the Readme file of the GitHub repository, list your objectives and any additional outlines that will help flush out the structure and info to be included in the Readme. Once you've done this, then you change the status to Ready for Assignment. In the Owner column, add your name. 

If this is the responsibility of a Flatiron team member, then you can ignore any piece of content that's in this stage as it's not Ready for Assignment.

**Ready for Assignment**: The lesson is ready for assignment. This means that the Readme in the repo will have a list of learning objectives and sometimes additional notes as guidance. 

**Writing**: When you are ready to get started on a specific lesson, change the stage from Ready for Assignment to Writing. Then in the Assignee column, update it to your name. If you haven't done so in the Owner column, update it to your name as well.  

When you're working on the lesson, DON'T make your commits into the `master` branch. Instead create a new branch and title it `wip-master` (or `wip-solution`, depending on the branch you're pushing the commits to). Code/type your content into this branch.

Remember to add the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and `.learn` files.

**Review**: When the lesson is ready for review, change the stage from Writing to Review. Then create a Pull Request from your `wip-*` branch. Remove yourself from the Assignee column. Someone from the Curriculum team at Flatiron will assign the PR to the appropriate reviewer and will update the Assignee column.

In the review process, the reviewer will usually have questions or comments which he or she will make in the PR itself. If there are no comments or issues, then the PR will be assigned back to you and is good to merge/ship. Either way, the PR will always be assigned back to you and based on the comments, you can either merge it, fix and merge it, or fix and assign back for another review.

**Complete**: When a PR has been successfully merged, you can change the stage to Complete
